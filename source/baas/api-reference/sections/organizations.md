# Organizations

These routes pertain to creating and managing organizations. It is unlikely that 
you will need to access this set of routes as this will be managed via the 
dashboard. It is documented here for completeness.

Organizations are intended to reflect groupings of applications and developers. 
This can also be used to reflect groups or divisions within enterprises with a 
regional or some other restricted focus. Organizations can have a hierarchy as 
well so that data (with appropriate permissibility settings) can be viewed by 
higher levels in the hierarchy. Billing etc. is managed at the organizational level. 

The organization model is still evolving as we cover more and more use cases. The current
organizaton model has the following data elements.
    
NAME | TYPE | DESCRIPTION
-----|------|------------
name | string | The name of your organization / company
orgId | string | This is an autogenerated id
description | string | This is the description of your company
permissions | object | This is where you can assign developers within your company to various roles such as
 | array | admin: array of usersIds that have full admin privileges                    
 | array | dev: array of usersIds that can only touch code. No billing etc.           
 | array | payment: array of usersIds that can only touch billing. No code etc..      
 | array | viewOther: array of usersIds that can view all data except PHI data        
 | array | viewPhi: array of usersIds that can view all data plus PHI data
