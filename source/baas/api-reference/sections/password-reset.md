# Password Reset

Catalyze offers password reset by username. When a user forgets their password, they should be prompted to input their username and then a request should be made to initiate the password reset process sending that username. Once received, their uesrname is queried and an email containing a link to reset their password is sent to the email we have on file for that username. That link will open a form that asks them to enter their new password and will perform the reset once they click submit.
