# Automatic Updates

Once downloaded, the CLI will attempt to automatically update itself when a new version becomes available. This ensures you are always running a compatible version of the Catalyze CLI. However you can always check out the latest releases on the [releases page](https://github.com/catalyzeio/cli/releases).

To ensure your CLI can automatically update itself, be sure to put the binary in a location where you have write access without the need for sudo or escalated privileges.
