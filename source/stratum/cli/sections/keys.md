# Keys

The `keys` command gives access to SSH key management for your user account. SSH keys can be used for authentication and pushing code to the Catalyze platform. Any SSH keys added to your user account should not be shared but be treated as private SSH keys. Any SSH key uploaded to your user account will be able to be used with all code services and environments that you have access to. The keys command can not be run directly but has sub commands.
