# Sites

The `sites` command gives access to hostname and SSL certificate usage for public facing services. `sites` are different from `certs` in that `sites` use an instance of a `cert` and are associated with a single service. `certs` can be used by multiple sites. The sites command can not be run directly but has sub commands.
