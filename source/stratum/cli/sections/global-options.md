# Global Options

The following table outlines all global options available in the CLI. Global options are always set after the word `catalyze` and before any commands. Rather than setting these each time, you may also set an environment variable with the appropriate value which will automatically be used.

| Short Name | Long Name | Description | Environment Variable |
|------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| -U | --username | Your catalyze username that you login to the Dashboard with | CATALYZE_USERNAME |
| -P | --password | Your catalyze password that you login to the Dashboard with | CATALYZE_PASSWORD |
| -E | --env | The local alias of the environment in which this command will be run. Read more about [environment aliases](#environment-aliases) | CATALYZE_ENV |
| -v | --version | Prints out the CLI version | |
