# Stratum Cloud Storage

## Application Storage

As part of your Catalyze environment you have a fixed amount of “Cloud Storage” space that includes your application’s assets (the application code/binaries, static JavaScript, HTML, CSS) as well as disk space used by your database instance. This is not the same as a cloud-based file storage or CDN solution like Rackspace’s Cloud Files or AWS S3.

## HIPAA Compliant S3 Buckets

We have the ability to configure a HIPAA-compliant S3 bucket as part of your environment at an additional charge. We prefer this approach for PHI in the form of large images or PDFs.

Catalyze S3 buckets come with specific policies that mandate server side encryption and authentication to access the bucket contents. Please ![contact us][https://catalyzeio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new] for any questions about S3 buckets.
