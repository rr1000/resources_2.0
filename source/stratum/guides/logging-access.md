# Stratum Environment Logging

Catalyze has implemented a complete ELK stack for Stratum to manage acquiring and storing log data.

ELK stands for:

* Elasticsearch - for storing and searching log data
* Logstash - for sending and receiving log data to Elasticsearch
* Kibana - for a visual interface into log data

## Accessing the logging dashboard

Go to the logging URL provided for you. `https://{catalyze provided domain}/logging/`. For example: `https://pod01163.catalyze.io/logging/`

Or you can log into the Catalyze dashboard and click the logging link under your deployed environment. Log in using your Catalyze credentials.

**Your dashboard will look something like this.**

## Searching and Filtering
Use the search bar at the top of the page to search for logs.  For example, to filter application logs you can use the query:

```
 syslog_program : supervisord
```

You can view various time ranges of your logs by highlighting a portion of your events over time bar graph.
