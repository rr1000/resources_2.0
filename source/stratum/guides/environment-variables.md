# Stratum Environment Variables

## How do Environment Variables Work?

Environment variables in Stratum are set or reset for a code service every time the service is ***built*** or ***redeployed***. These variables contain data that the code service can then consume during operation. Environment variables are specific to a single code service.

## Why Are Environment Variables Important?

Environment variables in Stratum allow an application to consume information that is not appropriate for storing in a code repository. That type of data could include:

* Third-Party Service Credentials
* Dynamic Configuration Settings

## Pre-Defined Environment Variables

Each new Stratum environment comes with several pre-defined environment variables that contain important information for your application to function and vary depending on the services in your environment. You can view these in the [Stratum Dashboard][https://stratum.catalyze.io] on your code service as soon as your environment is created by Catalyze. Examples include:

* DATABASE_URL
* S3_BUCKET
* REDIS_URL

Before you make your first code deploy, make sure that your application is ready to consume these values!

First, click on the "View Details" link for the code service.
