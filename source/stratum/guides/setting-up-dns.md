# How do I setup DNS to point to my Catalyze environment?

Stratum environments are designed to have CNAMES or ALIAS records pointed at them. We create a public hostname for the environment that functions as the target of your DNS entries. You will receive your public hostname as part of your onboarding process after we provision your environment. ***Catalyze Public Hostname:*** `pod0123.catalyzeapps.com`

## CNAME Records

Use CNAMES for pointing specific subdomains at the Catalyze public hostname. ***CNAME Example:*** `mysite.wxyz.com CNAME pod0123.catalyzeapps.com`

## ALIAS Records

Use ALIAS records for pointing the bare domain at the Catalyze public hostname. ***ALIAS Example:*** `wxyz.com ALIAS pod0123.catalyzeapps.com`

## Wildcard Redirect

If you wish to redirect non-matched DNS traffic to your Catalyze public hostname, you can create a wildcard CNAME record with your DNS provider. `*.wxyz.com CNAME pod0123.catalyzeapps.com`
