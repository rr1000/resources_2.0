# What is a Stratum Organization?

In Stratum, an organization is the basic organizing unit for a client. Organizations have two components:

* Environments that belong to the organization
* User accounts that are associated with the organization

An organization is created for a client after signing a BAA and contract for an environment. The [Stratum dashboard](https://stratum.catalyze.io) is the management portal for an organization.

## Environments

An environment is a self-contained ecosystem for one or more applications on the Stratum platform and belongs to a single organization. The environment contains the services required for the web application to run, including [code](/support-languages-frameworks.md), [database](/dtabase-general.md/), [logging](/logging-access.md/), [monitoring](/monitoring.md/), and [add-on services](/supported-addons.md/).

Once you have signed a contract and BAA with our sales team, your environment will be visible in the [Stratum Dashboard](https://stratum.catalyze.io)

## Users

Catalyze user accounts represent specific individuals that can interact with the platform and can belong to multiple organizations within the Stratum platform.

When Catalyze creates an organization for a client, we invite the user to the new organization as an owner. From there, the owner can invite new users to the organization, manage their organization level permissions, and control the environments within the organization that a user can access.
