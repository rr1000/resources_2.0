# How can I add or remove users with my organization?

## Adding Users to an Organization

Adding users to an organization is managed through an invitation process controlled via the dashboard or the CLI.

### Dashboard User Invites

To invite a user to your organization via the dashboard you must first [log in](https://stratum.catalyze.io) with an admin or owner account. At the top of the screen, mouse over the `Organizations` dropdown and select the organization you wish to manage.

Clicking on the organization brings up the overview display for the organization. On the right side of the screen is the `Invites` panel. To invite someone to an organization, click the `Add User` button. Then, type in their e-mail address, select a role for them, and invite them.

Their invitation will be listed as pending below the invite box until the user accepts the invitation.

Once the user accepts the invitation, they will show up in the organization user list and an admin or owner can authorize their environment access.
