# How can I customize Kibana?

## Customizing your dashboard
Creating custom dashboards in Kibana can be useful if you want to visualize and  view logs in different ways.  To add a panel click the + button on the left side of a row and select a panel type.

Configure your new panel by filling in the appropriate fields.  For this example we will set up a pie chart with panel type terms.

Now that your custom dashboard is saved you can load it by clicking the load icon in the upper right hand corner and selecting the dashboard you want to load.

### Updating the default dashboard
Once you have created a custom dashboard and saved it you can set it to be your default dashboard by clicking the save icon going to advanced and clicking save as home.
