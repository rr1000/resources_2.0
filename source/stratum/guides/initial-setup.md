## Introduction

The following article is intended to get new users up and running in short order. We do have verbose, in depth write ups on each step outlined below. If you'd like to read more please see our official [getting started guide](//resources.catalyze.io/stratum/getting-started/). However it is recommended that you complete this guide before moving on to anything else.

What we'll cover in this guide:

- 1. Gaining access to an organization and related environment(s)
- 2. Downloading the CLI
- 3. Associating a local git repository with a Catalyze remote repository
- 4. Adding an SSH Key
- 5. Adding an SSL certificate
- 6. Setting up DNS
- 7. Setting up Sites
- 8. Deploying code


## Prerequisite: Access

Once you've been notified that your Stratum environment has been provisioned you will receive an email containing an invite link to an organization that Catalyze has created on your behalf.

It's important that you first create a Catalyze user account before clicking the invite link. You can register for an account [here](https://product.catalyze.io/account/register). If you've already created an account it may be helpful to [sign in](https://product.catalyze.io/account/signin) before accepting the invite.

Now that you've successfully created an account and signed in you can now accept the invite as the owner of the newly created organization. From here you can begin building your team by inviting members and admins to join. The video below demonstrates how one would sign in, navigate to an organization, and manage inviting a user. To learn more about the types of roles in an organization and what they mean, visit [here](https://resources.catalyze.io/stratum/articles/organization-access-controls).

**Recap:** [Sign up](https://product.catalyze.io/account/register) for a Catalyze account before accepting the org owner invite. Accept the invite, and use the [dashboard](//product.catalyze.io/stratum) to invite new users to your organization.

## Catalyze CLI

After gaining access to your organization you will want to download the Catalyze CLI (command line interface).

**Please note:** If you have an existing version of the Catalyze CLI you can run `catalyze update` to get the latest version.

 **Recap:** [Download](https://github.com/catalyzeio/cli) the latest version of the Catalyze CLI.

## Environment Association

Once you have the latest build of the Catalyze CLI you need to create an association between your CLI install and the newly created Stratum environment.

**Please note:** Before moving on, be advised that the Catalyze CLI is the primary tool for interacting with your environment. Our design philosophy is that the Stratum dashboard is the view layer into your environment and related services. The CLI is the tool that can perform actions on those environments and related services.

To associate your application repository to your Catalyze remote repository navigate to the root directory of your application. This will always be where the `.git` folder resides.

Once inside you can run the `catalyze associate` command. This command takes two arguments: `ENV_NAME` and `SERVICE_NAME`. The `ENV_NAME` is the name of the provisioned environment that you want associated with the application you're located inside of. The `ENV_NAME` is located on your contract as well as inside the Stratum dashboard. The `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the related code service. We automatically name this for you so in most cases you'll be looking for `app01`.

**Full example:** `catalyze associate DemoProd app01`

**Recap:** Run the `catalyze associate ENV_NAME SERVICE_NAME [-a] [-r] [-d]` command to associate your application repository with your Catalyze remote repository.

## SSH Keys

The next thing you'll want to do is setup your SSH key so you can push code to your Catalyze remote repository. Any SSH key uploaded to your Catalyze user account will be available for use with all code services and environments that you have access to.

First you'll want to create a brand new public key. This key should not be shared or used anywhere else. The following command should be run with the email you signed up with (**Please note:** After creating your new public key you'll need to add it to your ssh agent: `ssh-add KEY_PATH`).

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`

Once you have your new key you can add it to your Catalyze user account with the following command:

`catalyze keys add NAME PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`

**Full example:** `catalyze keys add my_prod_key ~/.ssh/prod_rsa.pub`

**Recap:** Generate a new public SSH key and upload it to your Catalyze user account using the `catalyze keys add NAME PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` command.

## SSL Certificates

Getting an SSL certificate installed is by far the most involved step in this setup guide. If you'd like to read more information than what is outlined below please refer to [this separate guide](https://resources.catalyze.io/stratum/articles/guides/self-service-SSL/).

To start, youâ€™ll need to create a cert. Make sure both the certificate and private key are unencrypted and in PEM format. If you have a Certificate Authority Signed certificate (CA-Signed) you can run the following command using your own correct file names/paths:

`catalyze certs create *.wxyz.com ./wxyz.com.crt ./wxyz.com.key`

If you have a self-signed certificate you can run the following command using your own correct file names/paths:

`catalyze certs create *.wxyz.com ./wxyz.com_selfsigned.crt ./wxyz.com_selfsigned.key -s`

**Self-Signed-Certs: You can follow our guide [here](https://resources.catalyze.io/stratum/articles/self-signed-ssl/) for creating a self-signed cert**

**Please note:** If for any reason you find yourself stuck you can run any Catalyze CLI command without arguments to see a full manual on that specific command.

**Recap:** Use a variation of the `catalyze certs create` command to upload your SSL certificate.

## DNS Setup

Now that we've successfully added an SSL certificate and made our first code push we'll want to point the correct domain name to the appropriate Catalyze public hostname.

The public hostname for your environment is unique, and will be sent to you during the initial onboarding steps. Alternatively you can run the `catalyze sites list` command to see your hostname.

The next step is to add the CNAME rules using your appropriate name and domain:

**Full example:** `mysite.wxyz.com CNAME pod0123.catalyzeapps.com`

You can also use an ALIAS if you have a bare domain and your DNS provider supports ALIAS records:

`wxyz.com ALIAS pod0123.catalyzeapps.com`

DNS name propagation can be verified via nslookup:

`nslookup mysite.wxyz.com
Non-authoritative answer:
mysite.wxyz.com canonical name = pod0123.catalyzeapps.com.`

**Recap:** Setup a DNS CNAME to point at your POD URL and verify that the DNS entry has propragated.

## Sites Setup

Once you have an SSL certificate added to an environment and the DNS name you want to resolve pointed at your POD URL, you'll need to create a site for the environment that uses the certificate and listens for that DNS name. Until you create a site, you will **not** be able to route traffic to your application.

This step occurs entirely within the CLI. To create a site, you'll use the certificate and DNS entries from the last two steps:

`catalyze sites create <your_dns_cname_pointing_at_catalyze> <the_application_to_route_traffic_to> <the_name_of_the_certificate>`

**Full Example:** `catalyze sites create mysite.wxyz.com code-1 *.wxyz.com`

Once the site is created, redeploy the service proxy in your environment to push out the new site configuration:

`catalyze redeploy service_proxy`

The redeploy takes about three minutes due to DNS propagation. If you navigate to the DNS CNAME you created earlier, `mysite.wxyz.com`, that address should pass through to your code service. Prior to pushing code, your site will display a 503 error code in the browser. However, you can verify that your certificate is correctly being used by checking the output of the following command:

`openssl s_client -connect mysite.wxyz.com:443`

**Recap:** Create a site in your environment using the certificate and DNS name you want to resolve to your Stratum application

## Push Code

The moment of truth. It's time to make our first code push, and it couldn't be easier. Navigate to the application's code repository (the same place we were in the associate step) and run `git push catalyze master`.

This pushes your master branch to the Catalyze master branch. If you want to push a branch that is not named master, see the following:

`git push catalyze mybranch_name:master`

**Please note:** Even when you're not using your local master branch it is necessary to use the Catalyze remote master branch.

Once you push code successfully, the application containers will take up to 1 minute to deploy.

**Recap:** Push your code using the `git push catalyze master` command!
