# How do I get access to a Stratum organization or environment?

## Create a Catalyze Account via the Stratum Dashboard

Before you can accept an invitation to an organization and gain access to any environments, you need to create a [Stratum Dashboard](https://stratum.catalyze.io) account!

If you already have an account, continue on to the next step.

## Receive an Invitation from an Organization Admin or Owner

An organization admin or owner must invite you to the organization. Instructions for them are [here](/organization-management.md/)

## Accept Invitation

Once invited, you will receive an email that looks like this:

The e-mail contains two options for accepting the invitation:

### Option 1: Sign-In to Dashboard and Click Link

Navigate to the [Stratum Dashboard](http://stratum.catalyze.io) and sign-in.

Then, click the link in the e-mail to accept the invitation.

### Option 2: Accept via CLI with Code from E-mail

Copy and paste the CLI command from the e-mail into your terminal window:

`catalyze invites accept 2b05740d-3254-4ab6-ab96-6c3958119842`
